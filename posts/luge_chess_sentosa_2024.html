          <p>Yuying stepped into the Singapore International Open 2024 not knowing just how sharp the battlefield would be. She played against professional adults — strong, experienced players with eyes that don’t waver. And she lost. Again and again.</p>

          <p>I watched her fight through those games. She didn’t complain. She tried. She sat through post-mortems. But by the end, I could see it — the heaviness in her shoulders, the quiet in her eyes. She wasn’t just tired. She was disappointed.</p>

          <p>As her father, I didn’t rush to cheer her up. I took her to Sentosa's luge instead. The luge, the wind, the coast — something simpler. Something that didn’t require calculation.</p>

          <h2>🛷 Riding Downhill, Standing Back Up</h2>

          <p>At the luge, something in her started to return. She smiled. She laughed. She returned to the child who smiles joyfully. The feeling wasn’t victory, but it was release.</p>

          <p>I didn’t tell her then, but I saw it clearly: She wasn’t broken by defeat. She just needed to breathe without a scorecard for a while.</p>

          <hr class="major" />

          <h2>♟️ Watching the World Championship</h2>

          <p>Later, we watched the <strong>World Chess Championship 2024</strong> — live from Sentosa. Two of the best minds in the world battling over 64 squares. As we sat in the crowd, she barely moved.</p>

          <p>She whispered to me, “I can't see Magnus, I can't find Anna, I can't meet Gotham Chess!”</p>

          <p>She is always more interested about people than games.</p>

          <hr class="major" />

          <h2>🪞What I Hope She Remembers</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>That a loss against the strong is not shame, it is common. There will be many losses in her path and she have to pick the losses that have the best values.</li>
            <li>That what matters more than the trophy is to learn how to use her limited resources better.</li>
            <li>Adult commonly taste defeat, even the best in the world but thats how records are made and broken.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This wasn’t a story of medals. But it was a turning point. She walked into that event as a chess player. She walked out as someone who had tasted real defeat — and didn’t let it define her.</p>

          <p>One day, she may beat players like the ones who outplayed her that week. Or maybe she won’t. But she’ll never be the same girl who sat down in round one. And that’s enough for me.</p>
